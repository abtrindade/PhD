\begin{abstract}
There exist various methods and tools to size solar photovoltaic systems. The tools are mainly based on simulations, which do not cover all aspects of the design-space. We present a sound and automated approach to obtain optimal sizing of stand-alone PV systems using program synthesis. In particular, our variant of counterexample guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) approach has two phases: first we synthesize the sizing of stand-alone PV systems based in power reliability, but that may not achieve the lowest cost; second, the proposed solution is then verified iteratively with a lower bound via symbolic model checking. If the verification step do not fail, the lower bound is adjusted; and if it fails, a counterexample is provided with the optimal sizing, linking the technical response of the first phase with cost analysis of the second phase. Commercial equipment data from different manufacturers are provided to our synthesis engine and candidate solutions are derived from financial analysis of the obtained sizing. Our synthesis method is novel and unprecedented to streamline the design of PV systems. Experimental results using seven case studies show that our synthesis method is able to output within an acceptable run-time the optimal PV system sizing, and a comparative with a specialized simulation tool shows the effectiveness of our approach.

\section{INTRODUCTION}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Cyber-Physical Systems  (CPS) are engineered systems, which are built from, and depend upon, 
the seamless integration of computational  and  physical  components~\cite{NSF2015}. 
During operation, such components must frequently adapt to the executing environment changes 
faced at run-time (dynamics of the physical processes) and must be able to continue to behave 
in a controlled and safe way, thus posing novel technical challenges for the software engineering of services and applications for CPS~\cite{Metzger2014}. Important quality aspects for CPS include scalability, e.g., ensuring that CPS applications can scale to urban-wide deployment environments~\cite{NESSI}.
Software pervasiveness in CPS places new challenges; in particular, highly dynamic environments, rapidly changing requirements, unpredictable and uncertain operating conditions demand new paradigms for software design~\cite{Filieri2015}.

While some research efforts do exist to enhance and optimize the software development processes for CPS, further investigation and discussion of better and more effective models are still needed in practice~\cite{Al-Jaroodi2016}. 
Among the opportunities for enhancements in the software development processes for CPS, there exists the need for developing new techniques and tools to support CPS requirements gathering and analysis with the goal of synthesizing correct-by-construction implementations of CPS. These techniques need to deal with predefined requirements enforced by the nature and inherited constraints of the target CPS. In addition, they should be able to provide verification and validation mechanisms for completeness, correctness, and consistency~\cite{Al-Jaroodi2016}. Uncertainty and variability, at the same time, can be dealt with formal verification~\cite{NESSI}. Energy production, distribution, and optimization are all CPS problems~\cite{UC}. 

Lack of access to clean and affordable energy is considered a core dimension of poverty~\cite{Hussein2012}. Progress has been made worldwide; in particular, the number of people without electricity access fell below $1$ billion threshold for the first time in 2017~\cite{IEAweo2018}. To provide universal electricity for all, decentralized systems led by solar photovoltaic (PV) in off-grid and mini-grid systems will be the lowest-cost solution for three-quarters of the additional connections needed~\cite{Hussein2012}; specifically grid extension will be the standard in urban areas~\cite{IEAweo2018}.

In order to simulate or evaluate a PV system, there exist various specialized tools, e.g., RETScreen, HOMER, PVWatts, SAM and Hybrid2 \cite{Pradhan,Swarnkar,NRELDobos,NRELBlair,Mills}
; and even general purpose simulation tools, e.g., PSpice, Saber or MATLAB/Simulink package \cite{Gow1999,Benatiallah2017}.  However, these tools are based on simulation; they have the drawback of an incomplete coverage  since verification of all possible combinations and potential failures of a system is unfeasible~\cite{ClarkeHV18}. 
 Optimization of PV systems is not a recent topic; since the 90's different techniques using different criteria to find ultimate combinations for design parameters, based on intuitive, numerical and analytical methods were proposed and developed. An ideal combination of any PV system is made by the best compromise between two considered objectives, which is power reliability and system cost~\cite{Alsadi2018}.
 
However, formal methods based on \textit{symbolic model checking} and its application to synthesize PV systems have not been further explored, which can offer a great potential to obtain a more effective design process to PV systems~\cite{ClarkeHV18}. Here, we use counterexample guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) for synthesizing optimal sizing of stand-alone PV systems using commercial equipment data. Given a correctness specification $\sigma$, our method uses that as starting point and then iteratively produces a sequence of candidate solutions that satisfy $\sigma$, related to power reliability. In particular, in each iteration, we synthesize sizing of stand-alone PV systems but that may not achieve the lowest cost. The candidate solution is then verified via symbolic model checking with a lower bound that serve as the minimum cost of reference; if the verification do not fails, the lower bound is adjusted. And if it fails then a counterexample is provided with the optimal sizing that meet power reliability and system cost.

Our work makes two major contributions. Firstly, the use of automated symbolic verification in electrical systems was uncommon in recent prior studies~\cite{abs-1811-09438}, and specifically their use in synthesizing PV sizing is unprecedented. Here, a list of PV components (i.e., PV panels, charge controllers, inverters, and batteries) 
can be fed to our proposed synthesis method together with user requirements and environment constraints, and our synthesis algorithm based on symbolic model checking can find the optimal solution in technical and economical terms. Secondly, we evaluate different state-of-art symbolic software verifiers with the goal of obtaining the best performance in our verification back-end for synthesizing optimal PV systems.

\textit{Outline}. Section~\ref{sec:Background} gives the background about related works, program synthesis, design sizing and validation of PV systems, and the mathematical modeling. Section~\ref{sec:Method} presents the automated formal synthesis proposed by this work. Section~\ref{sec:Results} is devoted to the experimentation, results and discussions. Section~\ref{sec:Conclusion} presents the conclusion and describes future work.

\section{BACKGROUND}
\label{sec:Background}

\subsection{State-of-art in Automated Verification of Electrical Systems}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The conversion of traditional power grid into a smart grid, a fundamental example of a CPS, raises a number of issues that requires novel methods and applications. In 2012, a Chinese smart grid implementation was considered as case study to address the verification problem for performance and energy consumption~\cite{Yukseletall2012}. The authors employed a stochastic model checking approach and presented a modelling and analysis study using PRISM~\cite{KwiatkowskaNP11}. The focus of this study was on how CPS integrate information and communication technology functions to the physical elements of a system for monitoring and controlling purposes; here the authors employed automated verification of certain quantitative properties of the system, as 	probability	of	node	failure	in	the	long run, impact	of	repair	service	on	the	failure	risk, and expected energy consumption, with no interest in power generation or even solar PV systems.

In 2015, an approach for applying Monte-Carlo simulation to power system protection schemes presented limitations of incomplete coverage of all possible operating conditions~\cite{Sengupta2015}. The authors proposed an automated simulation-based verification technique to verify correctness of protection settings efficiently using hybrid automata-temporal-logic framework. The initial focus was on relay operations and test-case generation to ensure early detection of design errors. The study was limited to power system protection and did not deal with electricity generation or even solar PV systems.

Other related studies from 2015 include a framework named Modana to achieve an integrated process from modeling with SysML/MARTE to analysis with statistical model checking for CPS in terms of non-functional properties such as time and energy~\cite{Cheng2015}. In order to demonstrate Modana's capability, the authors modelled energy-aware buildings as a case study, and discussed the analysis on energy consumption in different scenarios. The focus here is on smart buildings and HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems. The research did no deal with solar PV systems. 
 
In 2017, a researcher suggested the application of formal methods to verify and control the behavior of computational devices interacting over a shared and smart infrastructure~\cite{Abate2017}. The author discussed the aggregation of large populations of thermostatically-controlled loads and of PV panels, and the corresponding problems of energy management in smart buildings, of demand-response on smart grids, and respectively of frequency stabilization and grid robustness. The focus was on controlling the behavior of components, thereby verifying the smart grid as a ``system of systems'' within the context of ``internet of things''. The author used approximate model checking of stochastic and hybrid models.

In 2018, a verification methodology was proposed for the Cyber Physical Energy Systems (CPES) with applications to PV panels and its distributed power point tracking~\cite{Driouich2018}. This approach relied on representing unpredictable behavior of the environment to cover all possible feasible scenarios. The simulation results obtained by JModelica covered the system's complete dynamic behavior; however, it was evident the time consuming issue with almost three days of computer effort to verify the design space of one operation hour of the PV panels behavior. The work did not include the other components of a stand-alone solar PV system.

Another work from 2018 was the approach to modeling smart grid components using a formal specification. The authors used a state-based formal specification language named Z; they demonstrated the application of Z to four smart grid components~\cite{Akram2018}. The presented formal specification can be considered as a first step towards modeling of smart grid using formal methods. The starting point of this study was that a smart home can be considered as an integrated system consisting of various objects and system, which communicates and interacts with each other. This approach is base on Petri nets and from the premise that modeling of the smart home leads to clear understanding of the overall behavior of the smart grid.
%-----------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Program Synthesis}
\label{sec:ProgramSynthesis}
%-----------------------------------------------------------
%
The basic idea of program synthesis is to automatically construct a program $P$ that satisfies a correctness specification $\sigma$. In particular, program synthesis is automatically performed by engines that use a correctness specification $\sigma$, as starting point, and then incrementally produce a sequence of candidate solutions that partially satisfy $\sigma$~\cite{Abateetal2017}. As a result, a given candidate program $p$ is iteratively refined, in order to match $\sigma$ more closely. CEGIS represents one of the most popular approaches to program synthesis that are currently used in practice for CPS~\cite{Abateetal2017}, whose basic architecture is illustrated in Figure~\ref{Counter-Example-Guided-Inductive-Synthesis} and has close connections to algorithmic debugging using counterexamples and abstraction refinement~\cite{Alur}. 

The correctness specification $\sigma$ provided to our program synthesizer is of the form $\exists \vec{F} .  \forall \vec{x}.  \sigma(\vec{x}, \vec{F})$, where $\vec{F}$ ranges over functions, $\vec{x}$ ranges over ground terms, and $\sigma$ is a quantifier-free (QF) formula typically supported by SMT solvers. The ground terms are interpreted over some finite domain $\mathcal{D}$, where $\mathcal{D}$ can be encoded using the SMT's bit-vectors part. Examples of specification used by our method include house demand, energy, and battery autonomy; we also provide a list of equipment specification and price from different manufacturers and models.

In Figure~\ref{Counter-Example-Guided-Inductive-Synthesis}, the phases {\sc Synthesize} and {\sc Verify} interact via a finite set of test vectors {\sc inputs} that is incrementally updated. Given the correctness specification $\sigma$, the {\sc Synthesize} procedure tries to find an existential witness $\vec{F}$ satisfying the specification $\sigma(\vec{x}, \vec{F})$, for all $\vec{x}$ in {\sc inputs} (as opposed to all $\vec{x} \in \mathcal{D}$). If {\sc synthesize} succeeds in finding a witness~$\vec{F}$, the latter is a candidate solution (i.e., feasible combination of equipment) to the full synthesis formula, which is passed to {\sc verify}, in order to check whether it is a proper solution ({\it i.e.}, $\vec{F}$ satisfies the specification $\sigma(\vec{x}, \vec{F})$ for all $\vec{x}\in\mathcal{D}$). If this is the case, then the algorithm terminates, i.e., we have found a feasible equipment with the lowest cost; otherwise, additional information is provided to the phase {\sc synthesize}, in the form of a new counterexample that is added to the {\sc inputs} set and the loop iterates again. 
%
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.85\columnwidth]{fig2_rev.jpg}
	\caption{CEGIS applied to PV system sizing.}
	\label{Counter-Example-Guided-Inductive-Synthesis}
\end{figure}
%
One may notice that each iteration of the CEGIS loop adds a new input to the finite set $\text{\sc inputs}$, which is then used for synthesis.  Given that the full set of inputs $\mathcal{D}$ is finite because we use bit-vector expressions, this means that the refinement loop can only iterate over a finite number of times; however, {\sc synthesize} may conclude that no candidate solution obeying $\sigma$ for the finite set $\text{\sc inputs}$ exists and our synthesis engine can then conclude that no feasible equipment combination was found. At this specific automated formal synthesis of PV systems, we use a variant of CEGIS, where in each iteration we increase the expected cost of PV systems and this controls the {\sc verify} phase and the search by the optimal sizing.  %however, $\mathcal{D}$ can represent a large number of elements for the finite set  and our synthesis engine can then conclude that no feasible equipment combination was found. 
%In order to avoid exploring all possible values, machine learning techniques can be used in the phase {\sc synthesize}, with the goal of learning from experience (input-output samples), {\it i.e.}, learning from counterexamples provided by a verification oracle~\cite{Alur13}. In addition to that, a pre-processing stage could also figure as another block in the scheme shown in Fig. \ref{Counter-Example-Guided-Inductive-Synthesis}, between {\sc verify} and {\sc synthesize}, which would process counterexamples and provide larger and refined information to the latter, according to specification $\sigma$ and domain $\mathcal{D}$, in order to speed-up convergence to a final candidate.
Program synthesis engines that implement the CEGIS approach~\cite{sketch} can automatically produce solutions for a large variety of specifications; %, due to the combination of automated testing, genetic algorithms, and SMT-based reasoning~\cite{Sharma14}; 
here we have used software verifiers based on SMT solvers.%Here we used software model checking techniques implemented by different tools: CBMC~\cite{Kroening}, CPAChecker~\cite{Beyer2011}, and ESBMC~\cite{esbmc2018}.

\subsection{Sizing Stand-alone Solar PV Systems}
\label{sec:sizing}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
A PV system is illustrated in Fig.\ref{fig:blockdiagram}. It identifies the PV generator, batteries, charge controller, inverter, and AC load. 
The PV generator, which can be a panel or an array, is a semiconductor device that can convert solar energy into DC electricity. %In Fig.\ref{fig:blockdiagram}, there are two variables that depend on the site where the system is deployed and also the weather (i.e., solar irradiance $G$ and temperature $T$). 
For night hours or rainy days, we hold batteries where power can be stored and used. The use of batteries as a storage form implies the presence of a charge controller~\cite{Hansen}. The PV arrays produce DC and therefore when the PV system contains an AC load, a DC/AC conversion is required. That converter is called inverter; and the AC load dictates the behavior of AC electrical load from the house that will be fed by the system.
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{blockdiagramPVS2_rev}
\centering
\caption{Block diagram for a typical stand-alone PV system~\cite{Hansen}.}
\label{fig:blockdiagram} 
\end{figure}
\\
%
The sizing check stage will ensure that the system meets the standard project steps related to critical period solar energy method~\cite{Pinho} and adopting MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) charge controller, which is the most common one in practice. 
%
Firstly, we need to correct the energy consumption estimated to the load ($E_{consumption}$), which is carried out by Eq.~\eqref{eq:Ecorrected}, where the efficiency of batteries ($\eta_{b}$), controller ($\eta_{c}$), and inverter ($\eta_{i}$) are considered~\cite{Pinho} as follows

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Ecorrected}
E_{corrected} = \dfrac{E_{consumption}}{\eta_{b} \eta_{c} \eta_{i} }.
\end{equation}

%
We also need to estimate the energy that can be produced for each panel, called $E_{p}$, in Wh, defined as
%

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Ep}
E_{p} = Solar\_Irradiance \times Panel\_Area \times \eta_{p} \times 1000,
\end{equation}

\noindent where the solar irradiance is expressed in terms of $kWh/m^{2}$ and depends on the site where the PV system will be deployed; 
the PV panel area is given in $m^{2}$ and corresponds to the size of one PV panel, and $\eta_{p}$ represents the PV panel efficiency.
%
The total minimum number of needed solar panels ($N_{TPmin}$) is computed as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:NTPmin}
N_{TPmin} = \dfrac{E_{corrected}}{E_{p}}.
\end{equation}

Particularly, the total number of panels in series ($N_{PSmin}$) and parallel ($N_{PPmin}$) are respectively given by

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:NPSmin}
\dfrac{V_{mppt,min}}{V_{maxPower,TempMax}} \leq N_{PSmin} \leq \dfrac{V_{mppt,max}}{V_{maxPower,TempMin}},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:NPPmin}
N_{PPmin} = \dfrac{P_{total}}{Number\,Panels\,Series \times P_{max,ref}},
\end{equation}

\noindent where $V_{mppt,max}$ is the maximum operation voltage and $V_{mppt,min}$ is the minimum operation voltage of the charge controller; $V_{maxPower,TempMax}$ and $V_{maxPower,TempMin}$ are the maximum power voltage from the PV module considering the maximum and minimum operational temperature, respectively; $P_{total}$ is the total power demanded from the PV system and $P_{max,ref}$ is the power supplied from one PV panel in $Watts$.
%, $ V_{system} $ is the DC voltage of the bus, normally $12$, $24$ or $48$ V.
%
Regarding batteries, we must first define the total capacity of the battery bank, which can be described as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Cbank}
C_{bank} = \dfrac{E_{corrected} \times autonomy}{V_{system} \times DOD},
\end{equation}

\noindent where the variable $autonomy$ is a design definition; % and normally has a value ranging from $6$ to $48$h; 
$ V_{system} $ is the DC voltage of the bus, and $ DOD $ is the battery deep of discharge (considered of maximum of 25\% here).
%
Secondly, the total (minimum) number of batteries is computed as 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Nbtotal}
N_{B}total = N_{BS}min \times N_{BP}min = \dfrac{V_{system}}{V_{bat}} \times \dfrac{C_{bank}}{1 \,Battery \, Capacity}.
\end{equation}

Regarding the charge controller, it must initially meet the voltage requirement of the PV system, as described by Eq.~\eqref{eq:vcvsystem} to the charge controller voltage: 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vcvsystem}
V_{c} = V_{system}.
\end{equation}

The short circuit reference information from the manufacturer's solar panel must be corrected to the cell temperature because the field temperature is higher than the nominal or laboratory temperature, and PV system is temperature dependent, as 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:iscamb}
I_{sc,amb} = \dfrac{G}{G_{ref}} \left[ I_{sc,ref} + \mu_{I} \times (T-25) \right]. 
\end{equation}

The controller must meet the maximum current from the PV array given by Eqs. \eqref{eq:icmin} and \eqref{eq:icicmin} as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:icmin}
I_{c,min} = I_{sc,amb} \times N_{PP},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:icicmin}
I_{c} \geq I_{c,min}.
\end{equation}

The inverter sizing check is performed by means of three equations. Eq.~\eqref{eq:vindc} ensures that the input voltage of the controller meets the system voltage. Eq.~\eqref{eq:voutac} ensures that the output voltage of the controller meets the AC voltage of the load. Finally, Eq.~\eqref{eq:invcheck} ensures that the controller can support the total demand of the load ($Demand$) and the surge power ($P_{surge}$), where $V_{in}DC$ is the nominal input voltage and $V_{out}AC$ is the nominal output voltage of the inverter; $MAX_{AC,ref}$ is the peak power that the inverter can support.
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vindc} 
V_{in}DC = V_{system}.
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:voutac} 
V_{out}AC = V_{AC}.
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:invcheck} 
\left[ (Demand \leq P_{AC,ref}) \, and \, (P_{surge} \leq MAX_{AC,ref}) \right].
\end{equation}

\subsection{PV systems Optimization Criteria}
In order to select an optimal combination to meet sizing constraints, it is necessary to evaluate power reliability and system cost analysis for the system. An ideal combination for any PV system is made by the best compromise between those two objectives.

%
%%%To select an optimal combination of components from a PV system to meet sizing constraints, 
%we need to evaluate \textit{power reliability} and perform \textit{system cost} analysis for the recommended system. An ideal combination for any PV system 
%The optimal sizing of PV systems is made by the best compromise between two objectives: power reliability and system cost~\cite{Alsadi2018}. 
%Regarding power reliability, this work will rely on the critical period solar energy method~\cite{Pinho} as described in section~\ref{sec:sizing}. 
%the usual is to use loss of load probability (LOLP) or loss of power supply probability (LPSP). Based on the fact that here we are neither considering site characteristics nor the load changes over time, the reliability analysis will be developed only by the critical period method of PV sizing \textcolor{red}{What does it mean? Remember that we have software engineering audience}. 
%However, considering the system cost analysis, we usually find related studies done with Net Present Cost (NPC), Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), or Life Cycle Cost (LCC). Here, based on the fact that the deployment location is not specified, our study uses an adapted LCC analysis, where only the deployment cost is considered about the model, i.e., without the operational and maintenance costs~\cite{Alsadi2018}.
Considering the system cost analysis, based on the fact that the deployment location is not specified, our study uses an adapted Life Cycle Cost (LCC) analysis, where only the acquisition cost is considered about the model, i.e., without the operational and maintenance costs~\cite{Alsadi2018}.
\subsection{Stand-alone PV System Optimization Technique}
To recommend an optimal configuration for PV systems, the designer has to evaluate the design based on optimization variables.

Our synthesis algorithm will synthesize constant values; it starts with the input of manufacturers data and prices of PV panels, batteries, charge controllers and inverters (Line 2). After that, we define user requirements, i.e., house requirements and design definitions, from Lines 4 and 5. 

The \textit{for}-loop started at Line 6 controls the lowest cost to the PV solution. In particular, it starts with cost $0$ and stops only when the algorithm finds a feasible solution in which the cost breaks the $assertion$ stated in Line 22; if that happens, then our algorithm has found an optimal solution, thereby stating that the {\sc Verify} phase reached a satisfiable condition (\textit{SAT}). The $MaxCost$ value at Line 6 is just a very high value put as a limit to the \textit{for}-loop, that never will be reached because the optimal solution will be found first.

Our synthesis algorithm uses non-deterministic variables to choose one specific constant from a given list of PV panels, controllers, batteries and inverters (Lines 7 to 10). That procedure ensures that our synthesis engine checks all combinations of items from each equipment, and combine them to assemble a feasible (candidate) PV solution, which meets the user requirements.

Next, we use Eq.~\eqref{eq:Ecorrected}, Eq.~\eqref{eq:Ep}, Eq.~\eqref{eq:NTPmin}, Eq.~\eqref{eq:NPSmin}, Eq.~\eqref{eq:NPPmin}, Eq.~\eqref{eq:Cbank}, Eq.~\eqref{eq:Nbtotal}, Eq.~\eqref{eq:iscamb}, and Eq.~\eqref{eq:icmin} to calculate the sizing variables (Lines 11 to 17). The directive \textit{assume} (Lines 15, 18 and 19) ensures the compatibility of the chosen items from the list of equipment: the {\sc Verify} phase uses only the item (among all the possible ones) that satisfies the statements of Lines 15, 18 and 19. Therefore, our synthesis algorithm reaches Line 20 with one feasible solution, and the cost of that solution is calculated in $F_{obj}$ (Line 21). 

If our algorithm does not find a feasible solution among the item of equipment that were provided to our {\sc Synthesize} phase,  then the result is an unsatisfiable (\textit{UNSAT}), i.e., the program finishes and does not find a solution. It indicates that was not possible to combine the items of each equipment and create a feasible solution. 

The main challenge for the {\sc Synthesize} phase is to find a feasible candidate solution regarding the constraints and user requirements. Related to our {\sc Verify} phase the challenge is to find the lowest acquisition cost from a list of equipment and components that is provided from the {\sc Synthesize} phase. 

Note that the process described here in completely automated and that a validation is performed by our {\sc Verify} phase to ensure that the approach is sound.

\section{RESULTS AND DISCUSSION}
\label{sec:Results}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\textbf{Case studies.} We have performed two stand-alone PV system case studies to evaluate our proposed synthesis approach as described in the first line of Table~\ref{tab1}. Our synthesis algorithm was fed with data and costs of twenty-two equipment items from nine different manufacturers of PV systems. Furthermore, three start-of-art verification tools, CBMC,\footnote{Command-line: \$ cbmc -\phantom{}-unwind 100 filename.c -\phantom{}-trace} ESBMC,\footnote{Command-line: \$ esbmc filename.c -\phantom{}-no-bounds-check -\phantom{}-no-pointer-check -\phantom{}-unwind 100 -\phantom{}-boolector} %UAutomizer\footnote{Command-line: \$ ./Ultimate -tc config/AutomizerReach.xml -s config/svcomp-Reach-32bit-Automizer\_Default.epf -i filename.c -\phantom{}-traceabstraction.limit.analysis.time 900 -\phantom{}-traceabstraction.stop.after.first.violation.was.found false -\phantom{}-cacsl2boogietranslator.overapproximate.operations.on.floating.types false -\phantom{}- cacsl2boogietranslator.assume.nondeterminstic.values.are.in.range false -\phantom{}-rcfgbuilder.add.additional.assume.for.each.assert true -\phantom{}-rcfgbuilder.simplify.code.blocks true -\phantom{}-rcfgbuilder.size.of.a.code.block LoopFreeBlock}, 
and CPAchecker,\footnote{Command-line: \$ scripts/cpa.sh -heap 64000m -config config/bmc-incremental.properties -spec config/specification/sv-comp-reachability.spc filename.c} were used as our verification engine to compare our approach effectiveness and efficiency. 

\textbf{Setup.} All experiments were conducted on an otherwise idle Intel Xeon CPU E5-4617 (8-cores) with 2.90 GHz and 64 GB of RAM, running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64-bits. 
The experiments were performed with a predefined timeout of $240$ minutes.

\textbf{Objectives.} Our evaluation aims to answer two research questions: \textit{RQ1} (soundness) Does our automated synthesis approach provide correct results?, and \textit{RQ2} (performance) How do the software verifiers compare to each other?

\textbf{Results.}  CPAchecker was able to synthesize the optimal sizing of both case studies: the result was produced in $50.2$ and $37.2$ minutes, respectively. 
The violation of line 209 indicated in Table~\ref{tab1} is the $assert$ of line 22 from Algorithm~\ref{alg:verification-algorithm}. The results were tested by manual PV sizing and were sound (\textit{RQ1}). %, linking a feasible technical solution with the lowest cost possible, considering the equipment that were inputted to the code. 
CBMC and ESBMC produced \textit{UNKNOWN} result (\textit{timeout} or \textit{out of memory}); this partially answers the \textit{RQ2}.

\textbf{Threats to validity.}  We have reported a favorable assessment of the proposed method. Nevertheless, we have also identified four threats to the validity of our results that can be further assessed and constitute future work: (1) improvement of the power reliability analysis: to include loss of load probability or loss of power supply probability, which can make the analysis more accurate; (2) improvement of the system cost analysis: using Net Present Cost (NPC), or Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) criteria, in order to promote the acceptability of investment, or to include operational and maintenance costs to the adopted Life Cycle Cost (LCC) analysis performed at this paper; (3) to increase the equipment and manufacturers data base: this will increase the complexity of the optimization but the result will also allow improved sizing; and (4) to compare the results of our approach with an off-the-shelf PV sizing/optimization software: this will validate the results obtained and it allows a simulation-verification comparative.
