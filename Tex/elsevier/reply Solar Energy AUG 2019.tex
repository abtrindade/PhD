\subsection*{Authors'  Response to the Review Comments on manuscript ``{\mstitle}'' -- Manuscript Reference Number: \refnumber}

\vi

The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their valuable and constructive comments and suggestions related to the highlights file, which helped us significantly improve the quality of our material. 

According to the associate editor and reviewers' comments, our highlights file has been carefully modified and rewritten. 

Our responses  to all comments (in blue color) are given in the sequel, with clear indications about how and where they were addressed.

We hope those modifications in our highlights file and also our responses are sufficient to make our work suitable for publication in {\bf Solar Energy}.

Mandatory Editorial Changes: your highlights are incomplete sentences.

Please follow the Guide for Authors to construct the Highlights.
Your Highlights do not comply with the requirements stated in the Guide for Authors.  Failure to comply with this requirement will result in the rejection of your paper.

\begin{resposta} 
We thank the reviewers for this insightful comment and suggestion. Indeed, we had to rewrite the highlights doc file to comply with the correct expectation from {\bf Solar Energy} journal. 

Now our new highlights files states:
\begin{itemize}
\item Verification can be effective to validate stand-alone solar photovoltaic systems
\item Automated verification method can detect design errors better than simulation
\item ESBMC can produce better performance and soundness among automated verifiers
\end{itemize}


Compared with the original and not suitable:
\begin{itemize}
\item Approach detect design errors which are not easily detected by other approaches
\item Algorithm that implements the automated verification method 
\item Formal checking of the sizing and the operation of a given stand-alone PV system
\item Comparative of three state-of-the-art model checkers in five real case studies
\end{itemize}
