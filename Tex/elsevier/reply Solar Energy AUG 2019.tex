\begin{resposta} 
We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment and suggestion. Indeed, we had to rewrite the highlights doc fileit summarizes what was intended to be studied in this manuscript. Additionally, we have emphasized that the main focus of our study relies on the validation process of solar PV systems instead of the mathematical modeling, which was already investigated in prior studies over the last two decades; this particular information was carefully included in the revised abstract, introduction, and conclusion sections since it was unclear in the previous version of our manuscript. Regarding Figure 2, we fixed it as recommended by the reviewer. Moreover, we applied the same procedure to voltage $V$, in order to keep consistency throughout our manuscript.
